## ðŸ“Š GitHub Issue Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes real-time issue data from public GitHub repositories and predicts whether a newly created issue will be assigned to a contributor.
It uses the GitHub API to collect live issue data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and builds a logistic regression model that achieves ~88% prediction accuracy.

By understanding patterns in issue creation, labeling, and assignment, this project demonstrates how data science and machine learning can help streamline open-source project management and contributor workflows.

#  Built using Python, GitHub API, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Google Colab.
